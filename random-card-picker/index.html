                            moving forward when others would give up, and the refusal to accept anything less than the
                            greatness you are destined for.</p>

                            step forward, every effort you make today, is silently building the future you have prayed
                            and worked so hard for.</p>

                        <p>Growth is not comfortable and dreams are not cheap, but if you are willing to endure the
                            challenges, face your fears, and keep your heart fixed on the goal, then no force in this
